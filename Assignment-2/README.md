# Assignment 2

## Trees

### Ex 1: Printing a tree
`print(TreeNode root)`, `print(TreeNode root, int num)`
- The method has the root of the tree as its parameter and prints all the values of the Tree in an `Inorder` traversal by default. 
- Additionally, you can pass an additional integer `(1, 2, or 3)` and it will generate an `Inorder`, `Preorder`, or `Postorder` output.

### Ex 2: Printing a tree level by level 
`printLevelByLevel()`
- pending

### Ex 3: Printing the number of levels
`printNumLevels()`
- pending

### Ex 4: Implement a binary search tree
`insert(int key)`
- pending

`find(int key)`
- pending

### Ex 5: Implement a phone book

### Ex 6: Unsorted lists v.s. Binary search trees
